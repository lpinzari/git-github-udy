# Introduction

In this lesson, we'll look at:

- **git tag**: Adds **tags** to specific commits. A **tag** is an **extra label** for a commit that can indicate useful information like, this is the *beta release*.
- **git branch**: Allows to create branches that let you developed different features of your project in parallel without getting confused as to which commits belong to which feature. Allows multiple line of code.
- **git merge**: Allows to take changes on different branches and combine them together automatically. Combine changes on different branches.
