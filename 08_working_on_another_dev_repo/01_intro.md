# Introduction

In the previous module we looked at working with remote repositories. Now, we'll use those skills in this lesson to copy another developer's repo and to start working on it.

The skills we'll be covering in this lesson are:

- **Forking a repo**
- **Reviewing another developer's changes that have been made on a project**
- **Knowing what changes to make** now that you have access to the repo
