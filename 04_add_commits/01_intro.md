# Introduction

A repo is nothing without commits. So far, we have learned how to use:

- `git init`
- `git clone`
- `git log`
- `git status`

In this lesson, we'll build on top of these fundamental commands with:

- `git add`: Add files from the Working Directory to the Staging Index
- `git commit`: Take files from the Staging Index and save them in the Repository, which is what actually makes a commit.
- `git diff`: Displays the difference between two versions of a file. It's output is exactly like the output of the `git log -p` command, we used in the previous lesson.

Now, before we can use the `commit` or `diff` commands, we have to learn how to use `git add`. So let's get cracking.
