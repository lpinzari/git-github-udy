# Course Wrap up and resources

I just want to briefly run through all of the new and amazing skills you've acquired taking this course. You now know:

- how to set up remote repositories
- how to push changes to a remote repository and get changes from it
- how to fork a repository
- the initial steps to take when you start working on a new feature or change to the project
- how to create a pull request
- and the importance of communicating clearly and frequently with the other stakeholders in the project
