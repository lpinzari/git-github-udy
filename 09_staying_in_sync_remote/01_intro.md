# Introduction

Let's look at
- how to **sync** our new changes back to our forked repository and
- how to retrieve updates from the original source repository.

Some things we'll look at in this lesson are:

- **Create a pull request**: Learning what a `pull request` is and how to make one.
- **Retrieving and sync updates**: Retrieving updates that have been made in the `source` repository and including them in our `forked` repository.
- **Develop on an active pull request**: Working with an active pull request.
- **Squashing commits**: Squashing commits with `git rebase`.

Let's start with the `pull request`. We'll learn how to send suggested changes to another developer by using `pull requests`.
