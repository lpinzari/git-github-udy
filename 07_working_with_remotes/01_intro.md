# Introduction

Let's chat briefly about collaboration and why it's so important. Well, collaboration is incredibly beneficial because most of the time you won't be working by yourself as a lone developer on a project. You will be working with a **team** or maybe you are  **contributing to an open-source** project.

One of the key aspects of collaboration is being able to **communicate clearly**

- what you are doing and
- being able to work with others, like the **project's maintainers**, to see how you can contribute.

This communication can be kind of tricky when working **remotely** and **asynchronously**. After going to this course, you will be able to work with others on a **Version Control project**.

- Collaborate with others
- Use **GitHub** and it's features to plan changes and implement those changes.
- Contribute to an existing repo
- Add features to a project while it's in active development.
